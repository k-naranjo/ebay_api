    "In this chapter, we will provide a detailed overview of the implementation of a data pipeline. This process begins by collecting keys from eBay’s Developer Program, and ends in a cleaned data frame that is connected to a SQLite database.  Figure 3 provides a holistic overview of our data pipeline process. Orange elements within the inner rectangle are applied to each category in our predefined <code>categories_list</code>. The looping structure of the flowchart represents the automated nature of this entire process, which runs once every 24 hours. We start by loading in the developer keys provided by eBay and connecting to their API system. These keys are unique to each user and should be stored in a hidden .env file as a prerequisite of the loading process. The .env file resides in the same directory as our main code files. It is important to not share your keys with anyone!\n",
    " \n",
    "Once we gain access to eBay’s API system, we define the <code>geteBay</code> function. This function intakes a category number as an input, and subsequently connects to and makes GET request calls to the Finding API. This function must be defined before the iterative process described below can be completed.\n",
    " \n",
    "Once the  <code>geteBay</code> function  has been defined, we iteratively loop over each of the categories in <code>categories_list</code>, and each element is passed through the <code>geteBay</code> function. The <code>geteBay</code> function contains loops that extracts each of the desired features and cleans the associated data for each listing. The cleaned data is then stored in a new data frame.\n",
    " \n",
    "After the cleaned data frame is generated, we extract the <code>Item_ID</code> for each listing and use the resulting list as an input parameter to our second API connection with the Shopping API. The subsequent GET request calls allows us to mine further features of interest for each of the listings:\n",

    "- <code>category_id</code>\n",
    "- <code>item_specs</code>\n",
    "- <code>item_idlist</code>\n",
    "- <code>seller_id</code>\n",
    "- <code>Item_sku</code> \n",
    "- <code>image_url</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we merge the processed data from the Finding and Shopping APIs into a single data frame called <code>item_specs</code>.\n",
    " \n",
    "We then connect to our SQL database, ebay.db, and listings in the newly merged <code>item_specs</code> data frame are appended to the item_specs table. Once the new data has successfully been appended to the database table, all changes are saved and the connection to the database is closed. This process then repeats the following day at 12.05am.\n",

    "**Building a Simple App**\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting access to eBay’s developer’s program requires users to build their own application. This requirement is a result of eBay’s marketplace account <a href=\"https://developer.ebay.com/marketplace-account-deletion\"> deletion notification update </a>. The resulting application provides eBay with a communication channel to notify developers of marketplace deletion notifications. The architecture the application requires is relatively simple – it needs to receive eBay challenge code and respond with an output that hashes together the challenge code, the user’s eBay verification token, and the application’s endpoint. A 200 response should be produced in an output field in JSON format. An application that meets these requirements can be constructed in python using the flask package.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be reiterated that creating an application that can successfully receive challenge code is essential to accessing eBay’s production data. Production data consists of real listings from live marketplaces. Users can also develop test code to interact with eBay’s API system through their Sandbox environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The Flask application must be able to manage Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) requests. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between two applications. The method we used to get an https connection was through letsencrypt.com, which is a third-party website that provides a certificate to most hosted websites. The user needs to purchase a domain name in order to obtain an SSL certificate. Domains can be purchased through godaddy, Google domains, or other websites. There is no restriction on extensions. For example, we used a .club extension due to its low set up cost. After securing an SSL hosted domain for the application, login to eBay’s developer’s program and apply for Production Keys. Once Production Keys are obtained, you are ready to start building your data pipeline.\n",

    "For help on troubleshooting setting up a Flask app, look into UVA IT and various online resources including  <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-gunicorn-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04\">this tutorial</a>.
